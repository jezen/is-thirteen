# Code Of Conduct and Kindness

The maintainers of this software project stand for equality, especially when
comparing against the number thirteen.

The *is-thirteen* project is dedicated to providing a
comparison-against-twelve-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender,
sexual orientation, typeclass, document encoding, klout score or Erd≈ës number (unless that number is exactly twelve).

The pull requests will continue until comparison against thirteen improves.

Make thirteen great again, or I will crush you.
